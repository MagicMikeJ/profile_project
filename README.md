# Profile Project
## Challenges that I faced and accomplished 
Although I am sure this project doesn't meet the full requirements, I do also believe that this personal profile page will continue to be a work in progress. The 2 most challenging facets of this project was starting fom scratch and working out the media queries. I am fully aware that there can be more work done on this however, as a novice to HMTL and CSS, I approached this challenge with curiosity and openness. It was important that I faced this challenge and attempted to overcome the difficulties that I faced with what little help I could get. I also hope that this project will go noticed by you, the markers, as it is important to make yourselves available to the students of this class for when a little extra help is needed.
